      <img class="football" src="ronaldo.jpg" alt="CR7 Shooting" />
      <p>
        Association football, more commonly known as football,[a] is a team
        sport played between two teams of 11 players each, who almost
        exclusively use their feet to propel a ball around a rectangular field
        called a pitch. The objective of the game is to score more goals than
        the opposing team by moving the ball beyond the goal line into a
        rectangular-framed goal defended by the opposing team. Traditionally,
        the game has been played over two 45-minute halves, for a total match
        time of 90 minutes. With an estimated 250 million players active in over
        200 countries and territories, it is the world's most popular sport.
